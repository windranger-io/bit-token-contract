# BitDAO Token Contract
The BitDAO contract as deployed on Mainnet

The aggregated solidity source file was lifted from the BitDAO contract address `0x1A4b46696b2bB4794Eb3D4c26f1c55F9170fa4C5` on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1A4b46696b2bB4794Eb3D4c26f1c55F9170fa4C5#code)

## Development Process
### Git
Trunk based approach with a single main branch and ephemeral side branches.
https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/

Create yourself a user fork off the main.
For every changeset create a branch off your fork.
When the changeset is complete, create a pull request to merge the changeset to main.
After the changeset is merged, updated your fork from the upstream (main)

Branch protection can be used to enforce this behaviour for public repo's or private repo's when owned by Pro, Team and Enterprise organisations.

#### Git messages
Messages for commit and merge operations enter into the browsable log of project changes, providing a historical context for the project's development.
